= Things to keep in mind before enabling the Enhanced E-commerce plugin =
* Enable Enhanced E-commerce for your profile/view. This is a profile / view level setting and can be accessed under Admin > View > E-commerce Settings

* Also, add meaningful labels for your checkout steps. We recommend you to label as, Step 1 : Checkout View; Step 2 : Login; Step 3 : Proceed to payment

* Remove standard E-commerce code from thank you along with the ecommerce.js which is included by <code>ga('require', 'ecommerce', 'ecommerce.js');</code>. If you are using a third party plugin for e-commerce tracking, you would have to disable the plugin.

* You need to include ec.js. This can be done by adding a single line of code below your default Google Analytics code snippet <code>ga('require', 'ec', 'ec.js');</code>

* Users who are using Universal Analytics Tag in GTM, you will have to replace it with a custom HTML tag. Add the following code in your customer HTML tag. After adding the code, kindly replace UA-XXXXXXX-Y with your Google Analytics Property ID.
<pre>
<!-- Google Analytics tag -->
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
	
ga('create', 'UA-XXXX-Y', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
ga('require','ec','ec.js');
</script>
<!-- End Google Analytics -->
</pre>
* After adding the above code, you will have to activate your plug-in from the Settings page. You can access the setting page from here WooCommerce -> Settings ->Integration ->Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics.

* Find “Add Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking Code” in the settings page and check the box to enable the plugin

* If you have a guest checkout on your WooCommerce store, then Check the box “Add Code to Track the Login Step of Guest Users”. If you have a guest login but you do not check the box, then it might cause an uneven funnel reporting in Google Analytics.

*All the product sections on homepage other than feature product will be fired as Recent Product and will be available in product list performance report.

*All the product sections on product page will be fired as Related Product and will be available in product list performance report.
